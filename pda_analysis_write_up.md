2.1 Analysis plan questions
   
* Where you plan to get your data from?
   
* Summarise the requirements of the project.

* What parts of the data are you planning to look at?
 
* How will you ensure your analysis can be shared appropriately when finished?

		All of the Data will be gathered from the scot gov statistics site 
		(https://statistics.gov.scot/home). The project requires me to gain a 		deeper understanding of the data regarding tourism in scotland, such 		as what activitys bring the greatest income into scotlands economy, 		and what is the main demographic of people that visit Scotland (age 		groups, parents with childen etc.) The parts of the data i plan to 		look at include:
		
		 Dates for time lines and time series.
		 
		 The numerical data for the income brought in from tourism and the 
		 expenditure of the tourists.
		 
		 Location data such as regions of scotland and villages, beaches, 		lochs and where tourism comes from.
		 
		 Demographics such as age, familys with children, employment, marital 		status.
		 
	In order to ensure that my analysis can be replicated and shared. I will be uploading the project in its entirety to a git hub repository. I will also be saving the cleaning/analysis/visualisation aspects of the project on seperate .csv files.
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 

        
General Questions
We would like gain more understanding about our tourism data for Scotland. 

• What kind of tourism activity generates the highest income for Scotland?

• Is there a particular key demographic of visitors we should be focusing on? Who spends the most? Who visits the most?

• What type of locations receive the most visits? What kinds of locations do people spend the most in?

• Is there a particular method of travel our visitors arrive by? Some of our locations are remote and not easily accessible by public transport, so this would be good information to have.

• When looking at regional tourism, what insights can we gain? Where are our visitors from? How do they differ in the money they spend, nights they spend in Scotland, or number of visits they do?

• What type of accomodation is most popular? Is there a difference by location?

• How have general tourism rates changed over time?

• Is there any way to predict spending and visits for Visit Scotland?
