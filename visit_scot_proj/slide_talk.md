Good afternoon and thanks for joining me, 
ill be presenting my analysis for Travel Scotland regarding gaining more understanding about tourism in scotland

The analysis was derived from 6 data sets covering 
activities, demographics, locations, transportation, occupancy and regional domestic tourism (staycations)

I looked into several areas and ill be going through them with you.

slide 1
These are the points ill be going over, and ill be discussing each one along with some insight and suggestions

**Where are people spending their money?**
Over a 7 year period on average, going out for a meal brought in the most revenue. People traveling from far and wide to sample our deep fried goods.

surprisingly outdoor activities brings in only a moderate amount of revenue, despite scotland being famous for its outdoors. Possible need to invest in outdoor activites such as group hiking, or escorted nature trails

**What are they doing while they visit?**
Over a 7 year period most people visited friends or family. Possible correlation with students traveling back and forth. 

Again unsurprisingly from the first slide going out for a meal is another very popular option. Visiting friends and family is very likely related to that.

Visitor attractions lagging behind, being a tourism oganisation, investment in that area to bring more foot fall would be wise. scotland has very many attractions that could be put on the map.

**Who are they?**
Married couples with no children taking the lions share of visitations over a 7 year period.

Most attractions in scotland are family oriented. 

Possible underdeveloped oportunity for couples retreats. And couple orienteed adventures, wine tastings? Vouchers for a stay and a meal to bring more revenue to the hospitality industry.

**Where are they visiting?**
Cities and large towns taking up the bulk of stays and expendature. This explains some of whats happening in slide 3 tourism activities. With most of the tourists staying withing the large urban areas. 

This would suggest that some of the lagging activities such as Leisure activities and sporting events are not being used to their full potential, them being mainly inside large urban areas. 

perhaps some advertising these events to tourists and putting on transportation to them would increase their popularity, and thus brining in more revenue

**How are they getting here?**
On average over a 7 year period private cars are the most popular choice for traveling around scotland. With trains and coaches lagging around the 100 mill area.

This actually shows a failing of the public transport system in scotland. Ideally cars would be significantly lower. With this number of cars on our roads, polluting our countryside, which is one of our countries main selling points.

Modernisation and development of our rail system into our country side would reduce the cars on our roads and also bring in possible new tourist attractions or activities such as scenic rail journeys around scotland.

On the other side of this coin, enhancement of rest stops would bring in additional revenue to the country. 


**Where are they staying?**

Hotels being the leading choice here across most boards. Options for places to stay actually looks pretty even overall. 

With alot of scotland being remote, brining back to transportation. Ease of access to the remote areas would increase revenue to small towns with b&bs and small hotels. 

**How have things changed?**
Theres a clear sharp incline in 2015, things of note that happened in 2015 include a hurricane that left alot of scotland without power, and andy murrys wedding. none of this helping with tourism. 

The SNP also won the general election in scotland.

The forth rail bridge became a world heritage site, though that doesnt fully explain the sharp incline in tourism. 

And a new railway line opened between edinburgh and the scottish borders. Though this doesnt fully explain the increase

In summary the data i had available didnt explain the inrease in tourism, and more data would be needed to look into it further. 

The decline from 2017, could be attributed to the scottish independence referendum and uncertainty surrounding europeans status in scotland
